# Text-Summarisation-on-Conversational-data

I worked on text summarisation on conversation data as my major project. The idea is to develop text summarisation on combination of data gathered from various sources available in daily conversations within organisation. This includes chats, emails, documents etc.
A cross dataset was prepared by combining conversation data Samsum and long articles CNN Daily mail. These were chosen because they are publicly available along with human generated summaries. So it would be used for better evaluation. 
The data was processed and transformer models are applied. The results are evaluated based on the Rouge metric.
